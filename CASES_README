- damBreak [single]: default case, copied from <$FOAM_RUN/tutorials/multiphase/interFoam/laminar>. It is thoroughly explained at <http://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/dambreak/>.

- damBreakFine [parallel]: improved mesh resolution, as explained at <http://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/dambreak/>. The details of how to run a case in parallel are explained at <http://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/running-applications-parallel>.

- damBreakMod [single]: hand-modified blockMeshDict to include a topWall, so that a chamber/chimney is created at the right. Use <meld damBreak damBreakMod> to check changes.

- damBreakSwiftBlock [single]: blockMeshDict generated with SwiftBlock (plugin for Blender). The model is available at <of-dsgn/blender/damBreakSwiftBlock_cube.blend>.

  ·Scale and translate the cube shown in the default Start-Up File.
  ·Ctrl+Alt+U and activate SwiftBlock at Addons/OpenFOAM.
  ·Enable <SwiftBlock settings> at Object Properties.
  ·Change to <Edit Mode> and pick <Face select>.
  ·Set patch names and types (rightWall, leftWall, lowerWall, atmosphere). Mind that the default name is <defaultName>, while <defaultFaces> is used in the files copied from damBreak. Front a Rear faces should be assigned to <defaultFaces> to avoid problems.
  ·Choose <Set edges>, write the name of the object, <Cube>, and press Enter.
  ·In <Edit Mode> select the front face, set <# cells: 40> and press <Force resolution>. Alternatively, resolutions may be set to faces independently. However, consistency must be preserved.
  ·Click <Preview> to verify the resulting mesh.
  ·Write result to blockMeshDict
