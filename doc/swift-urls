Abstract: This paper presents an efficient block detection algorithm that can convert a complex wire frame geometry into a set of oriented multi--block structured faces or blocks. The algorithm uses a recursive depth first search in conjunction with the Grid Topology Model (GTM) data structure. The GTM data structure is a Boundary Representation (B--Rep) radial edge non--manifold solid modeling data structure. The block detection algorithm abstracts the user from having to manually specify orientation and connectivity information traditionally needed in other grid generation systems. Introduction A multi--block structured grid has multiple regions (blocks) within a single geometry that have their own corresponding local orientation and coordinate system. Each block may match other blocks at their end vertices, or be composed of composite elements that allow partial face matching. For clarity and brevity, only full face matched blocks will be considered in this paper.
