  abstract = {Abstract This paper and its companion Higuera et al. (2014--this issue) introduce the formulation of Volume-Averaged Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (VARANS) equations in OpenFOAM® to simulate two-phase flow through porous media. This new implementation, so-called IHFOAM, corrects the limitations of the original OpenFOAM® code. An innovative hybrid methodology (2D–3D) is presented to optimize the simulation time needed to assess the three-dimensional effects of wave interaction with coastal structures. The combined use of a 2D and a 3D model enables the practical application of the 3D \{VARANS\} code to simulate real cases, contributing to a significant speed-up. This is highly convenient and especially suitable for non-conventional structures, as it overcomes the limitations inherent to applying semi-empirical formulations out of their range or 2D simulations only. A detailed study of stability and overtopping for a 3D porous high-mound breakwater at prototype scale subjected to oblique irregular (random) waves is carried out. Pressure around the caissons, overtopping discharge rate and turbulent magnitudes are presented in three dimensions. The mean pressure laws present a high degree of accordance with the formulation provided by Goda–Takahashi. Furthermore, local effects due to three-dimensional processes play a significant role, especially close to the breakwater head. },

  abstract = {Abstract A simplified time-domain model for a fixed detached Oscillating Water Column (OWC) device is presented as a first step towards modeling a floating multi-chamber \{OWC\} device. The motion of a floating body in the time-domain is expressed by Cummins integro-differential equation, and based on it, water mass motion inside the chamber has been modeled here as a piston-like motion. Radiation, hydrostatic, excitation and viscous forces have been considered, as well as the added mass of the water in the chamber and the effect of the air pressure inside it. The equation of the floating body in the time domain has been approximated by a state-space method, which comes from the extension of the state-space system corresponding to the convolution integral of the radiation force. Experimental data have been used for model calibration and validation. Furthermore, the model has also been validated with a widely used Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model (IH-2VOF). These show that the model presented is reliable and computationally efficient allowing for massive simulations for a statistical design or economic feasibility studies. },

  abstract = {The present paper and its companion (Higuera et al., 2012) introduce OpenFOAM® as a tool to consider for coastal engineering applications as it solves 3D domains and considers two-phase flow. In this first paper, OpenFOAM® utilities are presented and the free surface flow solvers are analysed. The lack of specific boundary conditions for realistic wave generation is overcome with their implementation combined with active wave absorption. Wave generation includes all the widely used theories plus specific piston-type wavemaker replication. Also standalone active wave absorption implementation is explained for several formulations, all of which are applicable to 3D cases. Active wave absorption is found to enhance stability by decreasing the energy of the system and to correct the increasing water level on long simulations. Furthermore, it is advantageous with respect to dissipation zones such as sponge layers, as it does not increase the computational domain. The results vary depending on the theory (2D, Quasi-3D and 3D) but overall performance of the implemented methods is very good. The simulations and results of the present paper are purely theoretical. Comparisons with laboratory data are presented in the second paper (Higuera et al., 2012). },
